### Description
An introductory repository for the purpose of creating an example for myself. As a student: introducing basic github features is fundamental to my growth in establishing relevant familiarization with applications, services, and workspaces as I prepare for my chosen vocation.

### Tools used
None, besides the provided markdown editor.

### Files used *but not really*
[README.md](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Entryway) - Necessary file for confirming my basic understanding of github features.
